         "configurations": [
            {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
            }
         ]
      }
      ```

   5. Start Debugging
   1. Set Breakpoints:
      - Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set breakpoints where you want the code execution to pause.

   2. Run the Debugger:
      - In the Debug view, select the configuration you created from the dropdown.
      - Click the green play button (`Start Debugging`), or press `F5`.

   Key Debugging Features in VS Code

   1. Breakpoints:
      - Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines.
      - Conditional breakpoints can be set to pause execution only when certain conditions are met.

   2. Watch Expressions:
      - Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through the code.

   3. Call Stack:
      - View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls leading to the current point in execution.

   4. Variables Pane:
      - Inspect and modify variable values in the Variables pane during a debugging session.

   5. Step Controls:
      - Continue (`F5`): Resume execution until the next breakpoint.
      - Step Over (`F10`): Execute the next line of code, but don’t enter any functions.
      - Step Into (`F11`): Step into the next function call.
      - Step Out (`Shift+F11`): Step out of the current function and pause at the calling function.

   6. Integrated Terminal:
      - Use the integrated terminal to run commands and scripts without leaving the editor.

   7. Debug Console:
      - Evaluate expressions and execute commands in the Debug Console to test code snippets and inspect variable values.

   8. Exception Handling:
      - Configure the debugger to break on exceptions, both caught and uncaught, to diagnose errors in your code.

   Example of Debugging Workflow

   1. Write your code and save the file.
   2. Open the Debug view and configure the debugger.
   3. Set breakpoints where needed.
   4. Start debugging by pressing `F5`.
   5. Use the Debug Console to inspect and modify variables.
   6. Step through your code using the step controls (`F10`, `F11`, `Shift+F11`).
   7. Monitor the call stack and watch expressions to understand the program flow.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

   Integrating Git with VS Code

   1. Ensure Git is Installed
   Before starting, make sure Git is installed on your system.

   - Windows: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
   - macOS: Install Git using Homebrew (`brew install git`) or Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
   - Linux: Use your distribution's package manager (`sudo apt install git` on Debian-based systems or `sudo yum install git` on Red Hat-based systems).

   2. Configure Git
   Open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+` backtick) and configure your Git username and email:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   Initializing a Repository

   1. Open your project folder in VS Code:
      - Go to `File` > `Open Folder` and select your project folder.

   2. Initialize a Git repository:
      - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+` backtick).
      - Run the command:
      ```bash
      git init
      ```
      - This initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.

   3. Open the Source Control view:
      - Click the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window, or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`.

   4. Add files to the repository:
      - In the Source Control view, click the `+` icon next to each file you want to stage, or click the `+` icon next to "Changes" to stage all files.
      - Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal to stage all files:
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```

   Making Commits

   - Commit changes:
      - In the Source Control view, enter a commit message in the message box at the top.
      - Click the checkmark icon to commit the staged changes.
      - Alternatively, you can use the terminal to commit:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Your commit message"
      ```

   Pushing Changes to GitHub

   1. Create a repository on GitHub:
      - Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
      - Click the `+` icon in the top right and select `New repository`.
      - Enter a name for your repository, configure the settings, and click `Create repository`.

   2. Add the remote repository:
      - Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
      - In the terminal, run the following command to add the remote repository (replace `URL` with your GitHub repository URL):
      ```bash
      git remote add origin URL
      ```

   3. Push changes to GitHub:
      - Push your changes to the remote repository:
      ```bash
      git push -u origin master
      ```
      - If you have a different branch, replace `master` with your branch name.

   Key Git Features in VS Code

   1. Source Control View:
      - The Source Control view provides a graphical interface for Git operations. You can stage, commit, and manage changes from this view.

   2. GitLens Extension:
      - Install the GitLens extension for enhanced Git functionality. It provides advanced features like blame annotations, a Git history viewer, and more.
      - To install, open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for "GitLens", and click `Install`.

   3. Branch Management:
      - Create, switch, and manage branches directly from VS Code.
      - Click the current branch name in the status bar to view and switch branches.
      - Use the `+` icon in the Source Control view to create a new branch.

   4. Merge Conflicts:
      - VS Code provides tools for resolving merge conflicts. Conflicted files are highlighted, and you can choose which changes to keep using the built-in merge conflict resolution tools.

   5. Git Graph Extension:
      - Install the Git Graph extension to visualize your repository’s commit history as a graph.
      - To install, open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for "Git Graph", and click `Install`.

   Example Workflow Summary

   1. Initialize Git:
      - `git init`
   2. Stage Changes:
      - `git add .`
   3. Commit Changes:
      - `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
   4. Create GitHub Repository:
      - Create a repository on GitHub and copy the URL.
   5. Add Remote:
